# How much slower is public transit than driving?

Many of us complain about traffic, but don't see public transit as a viable alternative. I wanted to see how much slower taking transit is than driving in the SF Bay Area. To do this, I queried the Google Maps API for short trips between random points at random times on weekdays. While not perfect, this gives an average of how much longer a transit trips would be.
